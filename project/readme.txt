	1.Information
1.1 General Information

So why did we name our search engine the windrunner? Well I am so glad you asked! It is because, we originally wanted to make a DotA hero search engine. We both love the game (steam ID cLasik) and we thought it would be a cool idea. I bet right now you are thinking "But, DotA has a lot more heroes than just Windrunner why did you name your engine that? and I would say CHILL OUT I AM GETTING TO MY POINT!!, which is Windrunner is a champion (heh) that is about speed. She likes to run fast, and we hoped our search engine could meet her speed. The tagline for the web page when we make millions off of it is "Windrunner at your service!", because that is a line she says in the game and that is what our engine is here to do, help the user find what they want.


1.2 Database Speeds

With the Url list provided by our wonderful, amazingly handsome TA, Mr. Wesley May (+10 marks), our crawler was able to create a fairly large word database (~2Mb), url database (~1.5 Mb), and title database (~17 kb). It takes about 13 minutes on ece machines and about 45min-1hour on my crappy laptop , to create the full database. So here we have provided a database of the URL list you have given us.
=============================================================================================================================================
	2.Extra Packages or other things needed

Well if you plan on making another database with our crawler from another urllist, you might want to get a coffee and watch an episode of "The Walking Dead" while its going (or mark another groups assignment,I am not the boss of you do what you want =D)

Make sure all the file databases are present (worddb,docdb,titledb,prresults). THESE FILES MUST BE PRESENT with the rest of our python files.

If using new urllist, delete everything inside of the databases first!

Other than that, no extra packages are necessary beyond what was required by the project description.

=============================================================================================================================================
	3. Instructions to start
 (TL;DR) No special installations or extra packages other than what is required by project description just run normally.
 Step 1: Turn on your computer.
 Step 2: login into computer.
 Step 3: HOW DID YOU READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS IF YOUR COMPUTER WASN'T ON!?!?!
 Step 4: If using default urllist, do not run the crawler. (unless you want an hour break)
 Step 4.1: If using diff urllist, delete everything inside all the databases. Then in crawler, change the value in main to specify the name of your new url text file (or replace all the urls in that file or just rename new url list to what the old urllist name to "urllist").
 Step 4.2 Run crawler. (and get a coffee)
 Step 4.3 Get another coffee (This could take awhile)
 Step 5: If crawler finally done, start search engine (choo choo!) and search for words.
 Step 6: Give mark of 100% to this project =).

	5.Future Plans
-If someone enters random garbage, by rilling their face on keyboard return page about bill Cosby (flip-flop-bibbitty-bop)
-Make it an actual pure dota search engine, that can return the heroes recommend item build and skill order build.
-Sleep!
